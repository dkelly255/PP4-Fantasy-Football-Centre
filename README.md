# Django Blog
Django Blog is a Python & Django based web application that will allow users to browse, read, and comment on articles which cover many aspects and perspectives on the Django Web Development framework:

Please note - I originally started this project as a Fantasy Football Content blog/website but during development it has subsequently evolved into a blog about Django - primarily due to the quantity of content and material I was researching in relation to learning the framework, I found that writing articles about Django helped contribute to, and accelerate, the learning process. 

All elements of the Django project directory structure, and Heroku deployment have been renamed accordingly, with the exception of the overall project directory (which still bears the name `fantasyfootballcenter`)

Below are the list of key sections of the Readme document to help users familiarize themselves with how the application was designed & developed, and how it operates.
