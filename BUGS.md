## Resolved Bugs

### 1. Connection Refused - Error code 111

This bug was initially present when trying to sign-up a new user for an account after providing the user's email & password details. 

![Error Snapshot](readme/bug1.png)

The error is caused when an email Backend is missing from the Settings.py file, and has been solved by adding the email backend and the default "from" email using the following code:

- `EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'`
- `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'your choice of email'`

In keeping with the Agile methodology I am using to manage this project, the issue has now been moved to "closed" in Github's issues tracker:

### 4. Add email address - username display error 

If an administrator tries to add an email address for a previously registered user (who did not include an email address), the system will not recognise the username, but will only recognise the user "number" - for example, username "brian" has usernumber "3". The username is not recognised by the system, but the usernumber "3" will be recognised:
