## 3. Automated Testing:

### (i). Testing The Question Model's "was_published_recently" method 
The tests below are part of the Automated testing procedures I have used to prove out the functionality of some of the core aspects within the poll application. Please note - as called out in the readme credits section, and as noted in the poll/tests.py module code comments, I have heavily utilised the testing section of the [official Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial05/) in arriving at and building these tests, as they are effective at testing my poll app funcitonality for the purposes of the Blog Project:

Automated Test | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail
 ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- 
  test_was_published_recently_with_future_question(self):| The method should return a "False" value if the question's publication date is in the future | The initial test run returned a value of true which caused my automated test to Fail | Fail (see screenshot below)

![Test1](readme/AT_1.png)

The solution to resolve this test error was to update the method in the Question model to ensure it returns "False" for dates in the future, and "True" for dates in the past. Upon making this change you can see the updated test results below:

Automated Test | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail
 ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- 
  test_was_published_recently_with_future_question(self):| The method should return a "False" value if the question's publication date is in the future | As expected | Pass (see screenshot below)

![Test2](readme/AT_2.png)

Automated Test | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail
 ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- 
  test_was_published_recently_with_old_question(self):| The method should return a "False" value if the question's publication date is older than one day | As expected | Pass 
  test_was_published_recently_with_recent_question(self):| The method should return a "True" value if the question's publication date is within the last one day | As expected | Pass

### (ii). Testing The Poll's View "IndexView"  

Automated Test | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail
 ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- 
  test_no_questions(self):| If no questions exist in the poll, the error message "No Polls exist" should be displayed | The method functions as expected | Pass 
  test_past_question(self):| Questions with a published date in the past should be displayed on the polls index page | Method functions as expected | Pass
  test_future_question(self):| Questions with a publication date in the *future* should not be displayed on the polls index page | Method functions as expected | Pass
  test_future_question_and_past_question(self):| Only questions with a publication date in the past should be displayed on the poll index page, even if both past and future questions exist | Method functions as expected | Pass
  test_two_past_questions(self):| The polls question index page should be able to display multiple questions simultaneously | Method functions as expected | Pass

### (iii). Testing The Poll's View "DetailView"  

Automated Test | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail
 ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- 
  test_future_question(self):| A 404 error should be returned for the DetailView of a question with a publication date in the future | The method functions as expected | Pass 
  test_past_question(self):| The question's text should be displayed for the detail view of a question with a published date in the past | Method functions as expected | Pass

## 5. Accessibility Testing

The DevTools suite, and Lighthouse were used to audit the site's accessibility and found the only initial accessiblity deficiencies in the site were generally driven by Search Engine Optimisation and in some cases, Accessibility. The pre-SEO adjusted Lighthouse scores (with SEO deficiency) are shown below for reference
