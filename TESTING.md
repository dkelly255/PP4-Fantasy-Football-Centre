## 3. Automated Testing:

### (i). Testing The Question Model's "was_published_recently" method 
The tests below are part of the Automated testing procedures I have used to prove out the functionality of some of the core aspects within the poll application. Please note - as called out in the readme credits section, and as noted in the poll/tests.py module code comments, I have heavily utilised the testing section of the [official Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial05/) in arriving at and building these tests, as they are effective at testing my poll app funcitonality for the purposes of the Blog Project:

Automated Test | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail
 ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- 
  test_was_published_recently_with_future_question(self):| The method should return a "False" value if the question's publication date is in the future | The initial test run returned a value of true which caused my automated test to Fail | Fail (see screenshot below)

![Test1](readme/AT_1.png)

The solution to resolve this test error was to update the method in the Question model to ensure it returns "False" for dates in the future, and "True" for dates in the past. Upon making this change you can see the updated test results below:

Automated Test | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail
 ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- 
  test_was_published_recently_with_future_question(self):| The method should return a "False" value if the question's publication date is in the future | As expected | Pass (see screenshot below)

![Test2](readme/AT_2.png)

Automated Test | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail
 ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- 
  test_was_published_recently_with_old_question(self):| The method should return a "False" value if the question's publication date is older than one day | As expected | Pass 
  test_was_published_recently_with_recent_question(self):| The method should return a "True" value if the question's publication date is within the last one day | As expected | Pass

### (ii). Testing The Poll's View "IndexView"  

Automated Test | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail
 ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- 
  test_no_questions(self):| If no questions exist in the poll, the error message "No Polls exist" should be displayed | The method functions as expected | Pass 
  test_past_question(self):| Questions with a published date in the past should be displayed on the polls index page | Method functions as expected | Pass
  test_future_question(self):| Questions with a publication date in the *future* should not be displayed on the polls index page | Method functions as expected | Pass
  test_future_question_and_past_question(self):| Only questions with a publication date in the past should be displayed on the poll index page, even if both past and future questions exist. | Method functions as expected | Pass
  test_two_past_questions(self):| The polls question index page should be able to display multiple questions simultaneously. (Please note: see [Bug #4](https://github.com/dkelly255/pp4-django-blog#4-poll-app-questions-displaying-in-reverse-order) for additional context on how this test was updated to account for changes in the `IndexView`) | Method functions as expected | Pass

### (iii). Testing The Poll's View "DetailView"  

Automated Test | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail
 ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- 
  test_future_question(self):| A 404 error should be returned for the DetailView of a question with a publication date in the future | The method functions as expected | Pass 
  test_past_question(self):| The question's text should be displayed for the detail view of a question with a published date in the past | Method functions as expected | Pass


## 4. Javascript Testing

As part of my testing activities I have also designed and implemented the Javascript test procedures below. The Javascript content of the site is primarly related to the notification messaging features, and I felt that manual test procedures would best fit the functionality involved:

No. |Test Case | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail
 ------------- |------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- 
  1 | User Login Message Notification | A user should be greeted with a `login success` notification message when they succesfully log in, the message should disappear again after the pre-set timeinterval in the Javascript function | The notification message appears and disappears as expected | Pass
  2 | User Logout Message Notification | A user should be greeted with a `logout` notification message when they succesfully log out, the message should disappear again after the pre-set timeinterval in the Javascript function | The notification message appears and disappears as expected | Pass
  3 | Account Creation Notification | A user should be greeted with a notification message when they succesfully create an account, the message should disappear again after the pre-set timeinterval in the Javascript function | Initially the notification message appears but would not disappear again as expected - See [Bug #8](https://github.com/dkelly255/pp4-django-blog/blob/main/BUGS.md#8-heroku-javascriptstatic-file-bug---messaging)| Fail
  4 | Account Creation Notification (re-test) | The notification message should disappear again after the Javascript -specified time interval - See [Bug #8 resolution](https://github.com/dkelly255/pp4-django-blog/blob/main/BUGS.md#8-heroku-javascriptstatic-file-bug---messaging) | Bug resolved and functionality now operates as expected | Pass


## 5. Browser Compatibility Testing

The site's compatibility with different browsers and device sizes has been extensively tested to help ensure the best positive experience for site users & visitors, with some of the primary browser & device-size compatability screenshots being displayed below:

- Google Chrome:

![Chrome](readme/chrome.png)

- Microsoft Edge:

- Apple Safari (iPad Tablet):

![Apple](readme/safari.png)

## 6. Accessibility Testing

The DevTools suite, and Lighthouse were used to audit the site's accessibility and found the only initial accessiblity deficiencies in the site were generally driven by Search Engine Optimisation and in some cases, Accessibility. The pre-SEO adjusted Lighthouse scores (with SEO deficiency) are shown below for reference

- Homepage Lighthouse Scores:

## 7. Compliance Testing

This section will review the testing activities undertaken to ensure compliant code throughout the project, including the HTML code passing through the official W3C validator, CSS code passing through the official Jigsaw validator, Javascript code passing through the `jshint es version:8` linter, and that the Python code is consistent in style and conforms to the PEP8 style guide:

### (i) HTML Validation

All HTML pages have been passed through the official W3C validator without any issues, (with the exception of the [article detail](https://github.com/dkelly255/pp4-django-blog/blob/main/TESTING.md#i-html-validation) page - see context below) with accompanying screenshots of the output below:

- Home Page

![HTML Validation](readme/html-validation-home-page.png)

- Articles Index

![HTML Validation](readme/html-validation-articles-index.png)

- Article Detail^

^Please note - errors number one and two below are driven by the summernote text interface and are known & understood. The `100%` attribute on the `width` of the `img` element is required to keep the image at 100% of the width of it's parent element for formatting purposes. The `No p element in scope` error number two should not be displaying, as I have taken the full contents of the html invovled & audited them in my text editor and can see that every `<p>` element has a corresponding `</p>` closure:

![HTML Validation](readme/html-validation-article-detail.png)

^Also please see [Bug #9](https://github.com/dkelly255/pp4-django-blog/issues/27) for a note on how adding images via the `content` field in the Django admin panel's content field when writing articles may also cause further issues driven by missing `alt text` attributes that cannot be directly injected to the HTML via jinja or templating without the use of a special API which is outside the scope of this project.

^Note - Lines 167 and 132 in settings.py are generating an `E501 code` for line length (exceeding 79 characters by one character & three characters respectively) - this is known and understood, and per [this](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) section of the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/) guidelines I have made a judgement call that applying the guideline in these two specific instance `would potentially make the code less readable, even for someone who is used to reading code that follows this PEP.`
